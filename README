USB CCID IFD Handler
====================

This package provides the source code for a SpringCard Network CCID (Chip/Smart
Card Interface Devices) and ICCD (Integrated Circuit(s) Card Devices)
driver. See the USB CCID [1] and ICCD [2] specifications from the USB
working group.

Authors of CCID (based library):
================================

- Ludovic Rousseau <ludovic.rousseau@free.fr>
- Carlos Prados for the PPS and ATR parsing code (taken from his
  towitoto driver) in towitoko/ directory.
- Olaf Kirch for the T=1 TPDU code (from the OpenCT package) in openct/
  directory. I (Ludovic Rousseau) greatly improved this code.

CCID and ICCD readers:
======================

A reader can be in one of these list:
- supported
    SpringCard Ethernet Reader


Supported operating systems:
============================

- GNU/Linux (libusb 1.0)
- MacOS X/Darwin (libusb 1.0)

See also http://pcsclite.alioth.debian.org/ccid.html for more
information.


Debug informations:
===================

The driver uses the debug function provided by pcscd. So if pcscd sends
its debug to stdout (pcscd --foreground) then the CCID driver will also
send its debug to stdout. If pcscd sends its debug to syslog (by
default) then the CCID driver will also send its debug to syslog.

You can change the debug level using the Info.plist configuration file.
The Info.plist is installed, by default, in
/usr/local/pcsc/drivers/ifd-ccid.bundle/Contents/Info.plist
or set the environment variable LIBCCID_ifdLogLevel.

The debug level is set in the ifdLogLevel field. It is a binary OR
combinaison of 4 different levels.
- 1: critical: important error messages
- 2: info:     informative messages like what reader was detected
- 4: comm:     a dump of all the bytes exchanged between the host and the
               reader
- 8: periodic: periodic info when pcscd test if a card is present (every
               1/10 of a second)

By default the debug level is set to 3 (1 + 2) and correspond to the
critical and info levels.

You have to restart the driver so it read the configuration file again
and use the new debug level value.  To restart the driver you just need
to unplug all your CCID readers so the the driver is unloaded and then
replug your readers. You can also restart pcscd.
