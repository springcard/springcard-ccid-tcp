INSTALLATION PROCEDURE
======================

Installation from source:
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

get the ccid-x.y.z.tar.gz archive and do:

$ tar xzvf springcardtcpccid-x.y.z.tar.gz
$ cd springcardtcpccid-x.y.z
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install

By default pcscd and my ccid driver use /usr/local/pcsc/drivers/ as
directory for hotplug drivers. The ./configure script try to get the
directory used by pcscd using 'pkg-config libpcsclite --variable=usbdropdir'
So you should not have to use the --enable-usbdropdir=DIR argument.

Note
~~~~
This package is derivated from the CCID package from Ludovic Rousseau.
We disable USB and TwinSerie and add Network management for SpringCard PC/SC Reader.
We have made minor changes inside the def.h and ifdhandler.c file.(See _NETWORK).

libusb not found
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the ./configure script says something like:
  configure: error: usb.h not found, use --enable-libusb=PATH
You should use --enable-libusb=PATH to tell ./configure where to find
the usb.h and libusb.so files. The ./configure script will use
PATH/include/ to search for usb.h and PATH/lib/ to search for libusb.so


configuring the driver for the network reader
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You have to create or edit the file /etc/reader.conf. The file should
contain something like:

#FRIENDLYNAME      "SpringCard Reader Name"
#DEVICENAME        www.xxx.yyy.zzz:port:option:key
#LIBPATH           TARGET
#CHANNELID         1

FRIENDLYNAME      "E663"
DEVICENAME        192.168.17.100:3999:00:nokey
LIBPATH           /usr/local/lib/pcsc/drivers/ethernet/libspringcardtcpccid.so.1.2.3

You will have to adapt the library path to your configuration and library
version.

Binary installation:
""""""""""""""""""""

Contact your distribution support.


Test procedure:
"""""""""""""""

- check the reader is supported by the driver.
  Get your reader USB identification using the lsusb(1) command:
  $ lsusb
  [...]
  Bus 001 Device 048: ID 08e6:4433 Gemplus

  Look for 08E6 (ifdVendorID) and 4433 (ifdProductID) in
  /usr/local/pcsc/drivers/ifd-ccid.bundle/Contents/Info.plist
  Of course your numbers will be different.

  If you can't find them add them (if you know what you do) and/or mail me.

- (re)start pcscd with debug on stdout. Simply do 'pcscd --debug stdout'
  (you will need to have root priviledges). And look for:
  [...]
  readerfactory.c:1319 RFInitializeReader: Attempting startup of ReaderName
  readerfactory.c:1061 RFBindFunctions: Loading IFD Handler 2.0
  ifdhandler.c:76 Entering IFDHCreateChannel (lun: 0)
  ccid_usb.c:131 Manufacturer: Ludovic Rousseau (ludovic.rousseau@free.fr)
  ccid_usb.c:139 ProductString: Generic CCID reader v0.1.0
  ccid_usb.c:143 Copyright: This driver is protected by terms of the GNU General Public License version 2, or (at your option) any later version.
  ccid_usb.c:223 Found Vendor/Product: 08E6/4433 (GemPC433 SL)
  ccid_usb.c:224 Using USB bus/device: 001/047

  If you don't see this the driver is not installed correctly or your
  reader is not yet supported. Read
  http://pcsclite.alioth.debian.org/ccid.html#CCID_compliant to know
  what to do.
