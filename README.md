# springcard-ccid-tcp
Networked PC/SC driver under Unix/Linux with PCSC-Lite and Springcard's FunkyGate IP PCSC.

This work is based on Ludovic Rousseau's CCID driver (https://github.com/LudovicRousseau/).
Thanks to his work, I was able to build this library.

This library was build using PCSC-Lite v1.8.13, PCSC-Perl v1.4.23, ccid v1.4.18 and PCSC-Tools v1.4.23.

It has been compiled and tested on Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, Ubuntu 14.04,  RaspberryPi (2015-02-16).

To build, see the documentation doc/Springcard_CCID_TCP.html.
